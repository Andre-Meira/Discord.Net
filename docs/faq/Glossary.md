## Channel types

* A **Text channel** ([ITextChannel]) is a message channel from a 
Guild.
* A **DM channel** ([IDMChannel]) is a message channel from a DM.
* A **Group channel** ([IGroupChannel]) is a message channel from a 
Group (this is rarely used due to the bot's inability to join groups).
* A **Private channel** ([IPrivateChannel]) is a DM or a Group.
* A **Message channel** ([IMessageChannel]) is all of the above.
